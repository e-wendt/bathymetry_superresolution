Deep Learning Super-Resolution for Bathymetry Data


The oceansâ€™ seafloor forms the critical boundary
for geophysical, geological, biological, and oceanographic systems.
Nevertheless, because of the effort involved in acquiring
bathymetric data, the ocean is insufficiently explored and highresolution
maps of the seafloor topography are rare or often
inaccurate. Super-resolution, a method from the computer
vision field, can produce a higher resolution from existing
low-resolution data without surveying additional data points.
In particular, deep learning-based super-resolution has proven
effective in enhancing the resolution quality and recovering
high-frequency details in natural images. While deep learningbased
super-resolution methods for natural images have been
transferred successfully to many different application domains,
few works exist that apply them to bathymetric data. This
research investigates the performance of deep learning-based
super-resolution applied to enhance the resolution of bathymetric
maps and compares it with conventional interpolationbased
methods. More specifically, experiments are conducted
that compare bicubic upsampling with a modified version
of the ESRGAN, a state-of-the-art super-resolution model.
The experimental results indicate that deep learning-based
super-resolution models perform equally with conventional
interpolation-based methods when applied to bathymetric
maps.

This work was produced as part of my master's thesis. The repository contains the generated datasets, code for training a modified ESRGAN, code for evaluation, and the visual and domain-specific results. The master thesis and the corresponding paper are also available.
